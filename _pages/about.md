Hello, I am an experienced professional in the field of electronic engineering with a diverse educational background. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering and a Master's degree from the Erasmus Mundus joint degree program in Photonics integrated circuits, Sensors and networks from universities in Italy, UK, and Japan. My education has provided me with a strong foundation in the latest technologies and techniques in the field of electronic engineering.

As a freelancer, I have worked on several embedded system and IoT projects, gaining valuable experience in the design, development, and implementation of IoT solutions. Currently, I am working as a Scientific programmer for IoT research projects, where I am involved in an agricultural-based project that involves sensing, IoT, and managing virtual machines to collect and visualize data. This project is extremely exciting, and I am proud to be part of a team that is making a real impact in the agricultural industry.

In my current role, I am responsible for developing and maintaining software to support data acquisition and analysis, as well as managing and analyzing data. I have a strong background in programming languages such as Python, C, and Java, and I am skilled in working with various IoT platforms and technologies such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and IoT gateways.

I am passionate about technology and its potential to make a positive impact in the world, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I am excited to connect with like-minded professionals on LinkedIn and to explore potential collaborations and partnerships. Thank you for visiting my profile!
