A web-based user interface was designed and implemented to connect InfluxDB with Grafana, enhancing data visualization. Additionally, automatic monitoring and alerting for data delivery were extended using Prometheus. The project also included virtual server management in the LRZ Compute Cloud, which was carried out using Ansible.","highlights":["API development","Linux","Internet of things (IoT)","Python","InfluxDB","Grafana","Prometheus","MQTT","Cloud computing","Ansible","IoT Networks"]},{"name":"High Voltages","position":"IoT content creator","url":"https://lrz.de","startDate":"01.12.2017","endDate":"Present","summary":"I created and managed high-quality content for How-to blogs and video tutorials on IoT protocols, embedded systems, and Python programming, covering over 50 topics.
